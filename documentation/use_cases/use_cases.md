Overview
========
There are many, many use cases envisioned for the CDW once it is finished, and I don't want to foget them all. This is a place for me to jot them down for posterity's sake.

- A more advanced version of the Saint Louis Vacancy Portal (https://stlvacancy.com)
- CarFax, but for houses
- A more complete estimate of the tax burden of urban blight. Current models are based almost entirely on a) direct loss of tax revenue from vacant properties, and b) increase usage of city services (lawn mowing, increased crime, etc). By training a ML model on assessment data, then having that same model "assess" every property in the city as if every building were active, we can get an estimate of how much vacant properties are depressing property values around them.
- Does demolishing a vacant building, leaving a vacant lot, actually improve the neighborhood it's in? Look at this in areas with various degrees of urban blight, etc.
