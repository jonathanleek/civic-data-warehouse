Overview
========
The initial scope of this project is limited to publicly available property data within Saint Louis City. A full list of government files being pulled and the source from which they are downloaded can be found in /include/gov_files.json, but an incomplete listing  in a more human readable format can be found below.

I make no promises to the accuracy of the data, as I do not control the sources. All code related to the processing of the data will be included in this repository. I will also strive to document the data sources themselves to the best of my ability, especially in cases where I find the source documentation to be incomplete, incorrect, or difficult to understand.
