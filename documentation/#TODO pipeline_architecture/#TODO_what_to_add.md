1. High level structure and components
(data integration platform, data processing framework, data storage systems, orchestration tool)
Explain rationale and benefit of architecture design (performance, scalability, flexibility, cost-effectiveness)
Trade off and challenges of the architecture (complexity, dependency, maintenance of the components)

2. Data pipeline and workflow diagram
Extraction, transformation, loading, cleaning, filtering, aggregation
Use visual tools/standard notation (flowchart, dataflow diagram, Apache airflow DAG)
Label/annotate diagram with clear and concise descriptions (each task, parameter, condition, dependency)
